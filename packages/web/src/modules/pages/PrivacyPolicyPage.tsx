                                    We will only collect and use your information when the law allows us to. Most often, we will use your 
                                    information where:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We need to comply with the law</li>

                                        <li>You, or your employer have given us permission to use it in a certain way</li>

                                    Where we have got permission to use your data, you or your employer, or person/s who authorised your
