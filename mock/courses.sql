    'LEADING CHANGE',
    'This course explores the often complex and problematic world of leading change within organisations. Much of what has been learnt about change has evolved in the 20th Century and is less fit in a world emerging from the pandemic. The course explores what has shown to work in terms of evidence-based approaches and the increasing role of recognizing status threats and the role of neuroscience in helping leaders to effect change. The courses principal benefits are that it also stimulates discussion of why change programmes so often fail and how to avoid pitfalls.',
